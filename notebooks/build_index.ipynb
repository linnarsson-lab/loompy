    "## Building a genome index for use with loompy and cytograph\n",
    "\n",
    "WARNING: these instruction will create a genome index that is *only* suitable for use with 10x Chromium data. We create a composite index, with separate sequence fragments representing unspliced and spliced transcripts. Unspliced fragments will be generated from genomic sequence upstream of every poly-A stretch located inside of a gene locus. Spliced fragments will be generated from transcriptomic sequence upstream of every polyadenylation site in every known spliced transcript. This reflects the locations of reads generated by Chromium, but may not be suitable for other methods.\n",

    "We created a composite kallisto index (`gencode.fragments.idx`), with separate sequence fragments for spliced and unspliced transcripts. The IDs of spliced and unspliced fragments are listed in the `spliced_fragments.txt` and `unspliced_fragments.txt` files, so that we can later count them separately. For example, here's the first few lines of `unspliced_fragments.txt` (the last part of each ID, e.g. `A14056`, indicates that this fragment is located upstream of a poly-A stretch at position 14056):\n",
